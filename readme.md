**Yes, I use Arch btw!** 

Not because it's anything special or because Arch users are better than others, but because I love the community and the minimalist style of Vanilla Arch and it offers me all the options I need and love to create my perfect and minimalist OS without any bells and whistles to build yourself.

I've been using Arch as my main OS for a good 5-6 years now. At the beginning I kept installing it because I thought it was great to learn something and so I developed a strong love for Arch.

I use i3wm myself and now and then to test a little Hyprland and bspwm. Personally, I can't do anything with normal desktop environments like Gnome, xfce etc. Just like I can't do anything with Flatpak or Snapd. They're not all bad, but for me personally they're unnecessary and simply nothing.

I'm just here for private purposes and there's nothing to see or find here!

Here I only collect things for my private Arch Linux distro!
