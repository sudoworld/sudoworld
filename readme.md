### Welcome

SudoOS is a custom GNU/Linux OS for developers that focuses on utility and beauty and is based on Arch Linux.

SudoOS is a project that I run in my free time alongside my work and I therefore cannot / do not want to give a start date. The idea came to me when I was developing my 
private Arch Distro and maybe some people will be interested in it.

Important: sudoOS is under construction
```

sudoOS is a purely private and hobby project by 1 man without a team without financial interest or anything else. Therefore I can't say how quickly the work will be finished.* I started the project on September 10, 2023*
