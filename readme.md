### Welcome

I'm just here for private purposes and there's nothing to see or find here!

Here I only collect things for my private Arch Linux distro!

And yes I use Arch btw because I love it. Not because it's anything special or because Arch users are better than others, but because I love the community and the minimalist style of Vanilla Arch.


I've been using Arch as my main OS for a good 10 years now. At the beginning I kept installing it because I thought it was great to learn something and so I developed a strong love for Arch.
