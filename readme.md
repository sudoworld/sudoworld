### Welcome

SudoOS is a custom GNU/Linux OS for developers that focuses on utility and beauty and is based on Arch Linux.

SudoOS is a project that I run in my free time alongside my work and I therefore cannot / do not want to give a start date. The idea came to me when I was developing my 
private Arch Distro and maybe some people will be interested in it.
